use the sbt to run and compile.
In the folder run the sbt.
Then you can input the "run"
And then you could find 2 main classes:

 [1] server.MapReduceApplication
 [2] client.Client

you should open 2 terminals.
And select the server first
then in another terminal you could run the client.
In this folder you will find a screen shot.

In server and client, they will handle different files. I hAVE already circle out that.
